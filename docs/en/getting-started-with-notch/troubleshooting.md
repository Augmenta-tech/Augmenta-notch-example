# Troubleshooting

**Don't see point moving ?**&#x20;

* Make sure you have objects in the Augmenta Simulator or Augmenta Fusion scene
* Make sure you have the same TUIO and OSC Input in Notch as the Remote Port in Augmenta Fusion or Augmenta Simulator
* You can debug by clicking on Log Updates in Augmenta Fusion. You should see the sending bundle in the logger
* debug in notch ?&#x20;

**The Notch scene does not have the right ratio ?**&#x20;

* Make sure you have the same OSC Input in Notch as the Remote Port in Augmenta Fusion or Augmenta Simulator
* Make sure you receive data in OSC Node
*
* If it still doesn't work, restart Notch
